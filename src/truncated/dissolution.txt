n parliamentary and some semi-presidential systems, a dissolution of parliament is the dispersal of a legislature at the call of an election. Usually, a legislature in such a system must be dissolved on the expiration of a constitutionally specified term. Early dissolutions are allowed in many jurisdictions.
